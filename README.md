# Personal Website :D
This is my personal website, which I have coded personally using HTML and CSS. I made this website visually attractive to make the my
projects, acheivements, classes, etc. "pop" more. This website actually allowed me to express myself in a creative way, while also providing employers
with useful experience about me.
